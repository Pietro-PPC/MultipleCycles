# MultipleCycles

Here you can run 3 breeding cycles in a row

Start with MultipleCyclesF2 and it will source Cycle2 and Cycle3 

Try different models by sourcing: random forest(RF), neural net(ANN), support vector machine(SVM) or ridge regression(RRBLUP)

Models can use random(RD) or stratified clusters(SC) training set. 

Parent selections are made at F2

Relocate the parent selection script to select parents at a different generation

You may replace genetic maps and haplotype data with your own genetic map and SNP data.
